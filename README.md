# Quicksort

Author: Deven Kumar

This folder has two files with important code. 

The first one, ModifiedQuicksort.java, performs quicksort on a list of integers. It uses insertion sort to sort the pivots, then sorts the partitions between each pivot. The function also counts the number of moves and comparisons that occur during the sort. PermutationGenerator.java takes a list of integers and returns a random permutation of the list. This is useful for testing the quicksorter.
